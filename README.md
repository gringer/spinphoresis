Sino:bit arduino code for a spinning electrophoresis device

Eventually this will control a device to carry out water electrophoresis (for filtering DNA by size),
but at the moment it's toy code that demonstrates the use of the accelerometers and buttons.

A 2x2 square appears in the middle of the matrix, with a 2x2 square rotating around it. You can change the position of the square and the speed of the rotation:

* **A** -- Make the rotation faster
* **B** -- Make the rotation slower
* Tip the Sino:bit to change the centre position. Calibrated happens when the device is reset.
